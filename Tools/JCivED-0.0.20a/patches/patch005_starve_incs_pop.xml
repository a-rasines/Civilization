	<description>This pointless -yet fun- patch makes the population of cities that endure food shortage *increase* by 1 instead of decreasing by 1 in the original game rules... My very first CIV.EXE hack ;)</description>

To do this, you need a Hex editor, and find the following hex string, which should be at offset 0xD876:
Code:

FE 8F 73 70 74 03 E9 39

Replace the 8F byte with 87:
Code:

FE 87 73 70 74 03 E9 39

Et voila! Cities that have food shortage will increase by 1 size...

Hopes this enlightens your day with a pointless hack!

Nice! For me (english civ 474.05) the offset was 0xD92D and the original sequence of bytes was

FE 8F F3 70 74 03 E9 39

changed 8F to 87 and it works as you write
